# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 10, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I've completed the CSS section of Freecodecamp's repsonsive web design course.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and I'm very excited to be able to create through code. The excitement keeps me coming back for more.
